basically, the story is meant to be that days will come and go, strange things might occur that don't really make sense but to remain as calm and keep on going.  yellow square - sun setting and rising quickly (because days tend to go by faster when a lot needs to get done 'not enough time in the day'), purple is just strange things occuring that might distract the blue square which is meant to be the 'subject', basically.  so the feelings would be calmness despite the chaos.  i tried to do some of the expanding, slow down and bouncing but they didn't come out perfect, evidently.
